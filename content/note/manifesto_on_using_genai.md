This list of principles helps me concentrate on using Generative AI (GenAI) efficiently. It also serves as an introduction to this world. I want to consider why and how I will use it. GenAI is a powerful tool but requires intentionality to use efficiently and avoid creative atrophy.

## My principles

By mindfully integrating GenAI into my workflow, I aim to harness its power with ethical supervision and human creativity. This balance ensures that every technological aid enriches my original vision and augments my creativity.

### GenAI outputs with my ethical supervision.

I critically evaluate every GenAI output — reviewing and editing as needed — to minimize bias and ensure accuracy.

### GenAI for my creative efficiency.

I deploy GenAI to handle repetitive tasks, analyze vast data sets, and capture notes with a few personal nudges into what matters. This frees up most of my time for high-value creative work.

### GenAI to inspire me.

I harness GenAI to overcome creative blocks, move faster, spark wild ideas, and generate dynamic scripts. This enriches my original thinking by giving me clay to form original ideas.

### GenAI mindfully integrated with me.

I intentionally use GenAI to enhance my cognitive efforts without replacing the essential role of human emotions in creativity.
