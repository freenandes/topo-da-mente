What is Zigbee2MQTT?
- FOSS bridge software.
- Allows you to _get rid of your proprietary Zigbee bridges_.
- Supports various #zigbee adapters and devices.
- Integrates well with most home automation solutions.

To find #zigbee devices that will work with each other using MQTT, this is a comprehensive catalog to find specific devices, like the #zigbee remote I was looking for so long!
