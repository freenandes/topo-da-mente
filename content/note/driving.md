I was driving. I wasn’t myself. I wanted some distraction.

The road and the mountains were like the perfect set, but I imagined a circus.

Mechas, animals, airplanes, tanks, balloons, flying saucers, giraffes, cruise ships, giant people crushing trees with their feet. All were terrorizing me.

I forced my head to imagine something else, but it was lost and tired of this energy.

I imagined breathing the mountain air.

One. Two. Three. Four. Hold.

Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Breathe out.

Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen?

It was stressful.

I focused on driving, but the cars were menacing. Nothing worked.

I was not paying attention, but she kept talking.

I really wanted to reply. I was squeezing my chest to get something out.

I felt like a voodoo doll with the needles pushing through and perforating my mind.

I kept throwing a few words, but it became weird, so she gave up: “Let’s stop”, followed by a long silence.

We stopped at a station, finally.

It was cloudy, but I was not prepared for the cold. I closed the door and looked at her: “I’m going to the bathroom”. “OK”, I said.

I decided to open the door again and headed to the café. The wind was cutting my face and I felt alive.

The air was fresh. The tarmac was wet. I avoided some puddles.

The café was busy. I could tell it from afar. The windows were foggy.

I decided to enter. It was too loud and too hot.

Pieces of dialogs were invading me and none made sense. They were entangled and smudged.

My brain stopped processing at a certain point, and the voices became only a drone.

It was… cozy. I was not sure if I was panicking or if I was enjoying the background sound.

Went directly to the espresso counter. Someone else was there.

They looked at me and I felt ashamed. I was not brave enough to deal with my feelings.

I just looked straight.

“You want sugar?”

They couldn’t care less. They were looking at someone else they knew, behind me. “Yes! One packet’s enough”.

I felt a heat. I was on the verge of being taken by an ambulance.

“How many?”

“What?!”

“One coffee?”

“Yes, yes!” Humiliating. Just how I like my coffee.
