>“When I write a song, it’s not like I search my head (…) Songs just happen. And only after it’s done I see what that song is about, or who the song is about. A song, a photograph, a drawing — I always like it to surprise me. See, in Sri Lanka we don’t give too much importance towards thoughts, we feel more. So when I wrote all the songs I never thought about what they were about. Even now, some of the songs, I don’t know what I’m singing about. It was a feeling. When I write songs, I like how the words look, how the lines look on paper, the images the words create. With Glorious Din, it was all feeling, it had nothing to do with the mind.”

I like how Eric frames the creative process without much fuss. It's what it is. Music made spontaneously, following the moment.

I feel this is very insightful. It tells a very valid story of how simple it is, de facto, to create something. Can't get more punk than this.
