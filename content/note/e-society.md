For me, an e-society is the communion of people through electronic or digital technology that benefits from that infrastructure to improves the lives of its individuals.

I wouldn't advocate for everything to be digital just because, but I would work toward ensuring we could solve more problems in society through technology that exists today, underperforming, stalled by capitalistic saturation.

With technology, as a society, we could do **so much more** with **that will** to:

- provide free healthcare to more people,
- provide free housing,
- be more inclusive,
- eliminate capital accumulation,
- propose better solutions to environmental problems,
- form better consumption habits,
- and probably much more I cannot think of right now.

I think a big problem is the lack of concerted action. A big help would be forming more online communities that share these views and similar values and beliefs. TikTok ain't it.
