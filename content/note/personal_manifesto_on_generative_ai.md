## Preamble

I embrace Generative AI as a transformative tool that, when used responsibly, amplifies creativity while safeguarding against bias and complacency.

## Principles

### Ethical Oversight

I critically evaluate every AI output—reviewing and editing as needed—to minimize bias and ensure accuracy.
- **Efficiency & Focus:** I deploy AI to handle repetitive tasks, analyze vast data sets, and capture notes, freeing time for high-value creative work.
- **Creative Empowerment:** I harness AI to overcome creative blocks, spark wild ideas, and generate dynamic interview scripts, enriching my original thinking.
- **Mindful Integration:** I use AI intentionally, as a tool that enhances my cognitive efforts without replacing the essential human touch in creativity.

Conclusion
By integrating AI with clear intent and continual oversight, I commit to a future where technology empowers creativity, refines efficiency, and keeps my thinking ever-evolving.
