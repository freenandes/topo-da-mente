This listing of principles is a way to help me concentrate on using Generative AI efficiently. It’s also a sort of a kickstart of mine into this world. I want to make sure that I thought about why I use it and how I want to use it. It’s a powerful tool and needs intentionality to be able to use it efficiently and avoid creative atrophy.

## With ethical supervision

I critically evaluate every AI output — reviewing and editing as needed — to minimize bias and ensure accuracy.

## For efficiency

I deploy AI to handle repetitive tasks, analyze vast data sets, and capture notes, freeing time for high-value creative work.

## To empower creativity

I harness AI to overcome creative blocks, spark wild ideas, and generate dynamic interview scripts, enriching my original thinking.

### Mindful Integration

I use AI intentionally as a tool that enhances my cognitive efforts without replacing the essential human touch in creativity.

## Conclusion

I embrace Generative AI as a transformative tool that, when used responsibly, amplifies creativity while safeguarding against bias and complacency.

By integrating AI with clear intent and continual oversight, I commit to a future where technology empowers creativity, refines efficiency, and keeps my thinking ever-evolving.
