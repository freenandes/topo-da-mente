This list of principles helps me concentrate on using Generative AI efficiently. It also serves as an introduction to this world. I want to consider why and how I will use it. Generative AI is a powerful tool but requires intentionality to use efficiently and avoid creative atrophy.

## AI outputs with my ethical supervision.

I critically evaluate every AI output — reviewing and editing as needed — to minimize bias and ensure accuracy.

## AI for my creative efficiency.

I deploy AI to handle repetitive tasks, analyze vast data sets, and capture notes with a few personal nudges into what matters. This frees up most of my time for high-value creative work.

## AI to inspire me.

I harness AI to overcome creative blocks, move faster, spark wild ideas, and generate dynamic scripts. This enriches my original thinking by giving me clay to form original ideas.

## AI mindfully integrated with me.

I intentionally use AI to enhance my cognitive efforts without replacing the essential role of human emotions in creativity.
