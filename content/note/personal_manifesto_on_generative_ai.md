This list of principles helps me concentrate on using Generative AI efficiently. It also serves as a sort of introduction to this world. I want to consider why and how I will use it. Generative AI is a powerful tool but requires intentionality to use efficiently and avoid creative atrophy.

## With ethical supervision

I critically evaluate every AI output — reviewing and editing as needed — to minimize bias and ensure accuracy.

## For efficiency

I deploy AI to handle repetitive tasks, analyze vast data sets, and capture notes with a few personal nudges into what matters. This frees up most of my time for high-value creative work.

## To empower creativity

I harness AI to overcome creative blocks, move faster, spark wild ideas, and generate dynamic scripts, enriching my original thinking with pre-made .

## Mindful Integration

I use AI intentionally as a tool that enhances my cognitive efforts without replacing the essential human touch in creativity.

## Conclusion

I embrace Generative AI as a transformative tool that, when used responsibly, amplifies creativity while safeguarding against bias and complacency.

By integrating AI with clear intent and continual oversight, I commit to a future where technology empowers creativity, refines efficiency, and keeps my thinking ever-evolving.
