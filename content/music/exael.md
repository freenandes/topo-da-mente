## Collex

Well-balanced album that surfaces a lot of what I like in dub techno but in a different kind of way. It’s more synthetic, metallic and mechanical, glitchy, as in the 90s experimental wave of techno. I prefer this to listen to while working rather than trying to relax.

I find the cover hypnotic and suitable.

## infinite shore / xm

This musical snapshot has an incredible pace that resonates very well with me. Doesn’t try to impress with power but rather with the atmosphere that it creates with its cinematic vibe cycling and a drum’n’bass energy throughout. Found it energizing and fresh for the genre!
