## Music for turntable, guitars and sampled instruments

https://www.discogs.com/master/2207050-Slow-Attack-Ensemble-Music-For-Turntable-Guitars-and-Sampled-Instruments

Interesting album that involves me and has a deep cinematic quality to it. I like the jazzy guitar wavy echoes, reminding me of that guitar jazz from the 70s and 80s.

![This is the back cover and it's a similar texture but with inverted colors in relation to the front. The same black ribbon goes to the back, now showing to the sight with more written details](../attachment/vsc-paste/slow_attack_ensemble-231122090323.png)
