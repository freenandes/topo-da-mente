## Because of a flower

Soothing and inspirational vocals. Reminds me of [Julianna Barwick](./julianna-barwick.md) at times, but less minimal and more irregular in a good sense.

LP cover:

![Off white or beige background sleeve with the vinyl label at the center visible, with the tracklist in black over white. Top left corner with the artist's name, top right corner with the name of the album. It's in black and in a very decorative, cursive font that makes a little unreadable, firthermore the font size is small.](../attachment/vsc-paste/ana-roxanne-240124170856.png)
