The albums between ~2011-2012 and 2022 are a bit uninspired and have less experimental traits to my taste. Which is fine on a holistic level, but doesn’t energize my mind as I’d like without that industrial-esc styling.

## Nostalgia

Incredibly satisfying to me. It sounds like motorized rock with the metals shimmering and the bass filling in the space. Also like the sound dirtiness captured in the recording.

## Work (Work, Work)

Approachable and simple album with excellent melodies and trance-y motorizations that goes a lot to the #industrial side of things.

## Over the rainbow

I like where this takes me. Having this type of electronic music rolling in the background is truly energizing and inspiring for creative tasks. Reminds me of Vladislav Delay with its corporeal/organic-like synths.
