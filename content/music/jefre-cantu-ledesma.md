There is no apparent figuration formed from the strokes so it's an abstract painting.](../attachment/vsc-paste/jefre-cantu-ledesma-240325090008.png)

Sounds like a breath of warm air pushing your face with excellent harmonization. It also seems to have texture due to the graininess of the soundwaves. Excellent stuff.
