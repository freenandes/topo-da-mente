## Disco Inferno Go Pop

[Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/master/21375-Disco-Inferno-D-I-Go-Pop)

CD cover:

![Photography of a pastoral landscape, with a mountain far away and a blue sky with large white clouds, and with a white, large graphical icon on top of the photo, resembling the typical symbol someone would use for the diffusion of sound.](../attachment/vsc-paste/disco-inferno-240215164533.png)

![This image, from the inner cover, is like a very abstract representation of the pastoral landscape photo made with rectangles of colors. Predominant colors are the green for the land and blue for the sky. Other smaller rectangles represent the details.](../attachment/vsc-paste/disco-inferno-240215164603.png)
