Incredible online art resources, useful for research:
- [National Gallery of Art collection](https://www.nga.gov/collection/collection-search.html) (>50k images)
- [Art Institute of Chicago collection](https://www.artic.edu/collection?date-start=500CE&date-end=1700&subject_ids=books)

Massive art collections. They have useful search functions like searching for an object. I was searching for depictions of books inside medieval paintings. A very specific use case that these services were able to provide for free.
