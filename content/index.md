Welcome to this digital garden! You're at the gate, what will you do?

## You open the gate

My name is Pedro. I'm Portuguese and live in Lisbon, Portugal, with my wife and daughter. I work as a product designer in tech, and I identify myself as a creative person. I love arts, designing, sketching and experimenting with expressing inner feelings, experiences, stories, beliefs, ideas and contributing with useful messages, solutions and inspiration to society.

Here in this [digital garden](Digital%20Garden.md), I mostly write for myself, exercise cognition, and take notes that may come in handy to generate new ideas. They're for anyone, including me, to pick up, digest, and create.

I will mostly write notes about:
- #design
- #music 
- and more can be found at #index!

I believe in shared information and e-societies. I think we're heading toward communal knowledge, and it's important to be free of ownership, capitalization of ideas and propagate innovation that benefits society.

This garden is called "Topo da mente", which translates from Portuguese to "Top of mind" in a literal way — we don't use it as an idiomatic expression.
